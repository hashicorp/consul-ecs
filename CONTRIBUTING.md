# Contributing to Consul-ECS

Thanks for your interest in Consul on ECS. We value feedback and contributions from the community whether it is a bug report, enhancements, new features or documentation.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary 
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Reporting Issues, Bugs or Feature Requests

We welcome users to report issues or suggest features.

If you're suggesting a new feature (i.e., functionality that doesn't exist yet), please use our [issue template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-ecs/issues).  This will prompt you to answer a few questions that will help us figure out what you're looking for.  The template will also tag incoming issues with "Enhancement".  This gives us a way to filter the community-opened issues quickly so we can review as a team.

Check for duplicates when filing an issue. Please check [existing open](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-ecs/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-ecs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. 


If you're reporting what you think is a bug (i.e., something isn't right with an existing feature), please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps performed
* The version of our code being used for our product(Consul version)
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
