## Roadmap FAQs
**Why did you build this public facing roadmap?**

We know that our users and customers are making decisions and plans based on what we are developing, and we want to provide our users and customers the insights they need to plan.

**Why does your roadmap not have specific dates?**

Because the highest priority for us is to put out a secure and operationally stable product, we can't provide specific target dates for features. The roadmap is subject to change at any time, and roadmap issues in this repository do not guarantee a feature will be launched as proposed.

**What are the roadmap categories?**
* *Recently Shipped* - These are the features, enhancements or bug fixes that we recently delivered.
* *Up Next* - Features, enhancements or bug fixes coming in the next couple of months.
* *Researching* - This might mean that we are still designing and thinking through how this feature or enhancement might work. We would love to hear from you on how you would like to see something implemented. Additionally, we would like to hear your usecase or design ideas here.
